Like any other library or compilation system, a raylib project requires the different elements placed correctly.

Notepad++ comes with a bunch of scripts ready for compiling a raylib project for different platforms. Those scripts assume that raylib is installed in the portable folder path: C:\raylib

In some cases, it could be that user decided to move that folder; in that case raylib paths need to be reconfigured.

Check scripts, usually default path is set at begginning of the script.
