VSCode is an excellent choice of code editor when it comes to raylib. Getting set up with a new VSCode project is easy.

### Step 1
Copy the VSCode folder (and all its contents) from raylib/projects/VSCode to your desired project location. These files can also be found [here.](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/projects/VSCode)

### Step 2
Make sure you set the proper paths to your local build of raylib in c_cpp_properties.json and tasks.json. These will be specific to your installation of raylib. 

### Step 3
Install the "C/C++" VSCode extension.

### Step 4
Try launching by using the "Debug" launch configuration in the Debug tab.
