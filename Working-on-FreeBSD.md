# Installation

raylib can be installed on FreeBSD with pkg (prebuiled binary package, recommended):

```console
# pkg install raylib
```

or using the FreeBSD Ports Collection (building from source, if you want to modify the sources):

```console
# cd /usr/ports/devel/raylib && make install clean
```
